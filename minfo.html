            <h1> Origin of the word Ōhuiarangi </h1>
            <h2>Like most Maunga in Auckland, Ōhuiarangi was a pā.  The name Ōhuiarangi translates as 'the desire of Rangi'.</h2>

            Today, long shallow boundary drains that separated traditional gardening areas can be seen in certain light down the eastern slopes towards Gills Rd.  Terracing from the pā is still visible on the highest parts of the maunga.

            GEOLOGY
            The eruption of Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain occurred around 24,000 years ago. A series of explosions formed an enormous crater and tuff ring that was 500 metres wide. You can still see the highest crest of the original tuff ring just to the north and east of the maunga - now built up with houses along Half Moon Rise.

            RECENT HISTORY
            European settlers gave the name Pigeon Mountain to this maunga, for the large numbers of kererū / native wood pigeon residing on and around this maunga in the 1800s.

            Like so many of our maunga, Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain was extensively quarried.  This first began in 1913 and escalated during the 1950s before ending in the 1970s following a community campaign to cease all quarrying activity.  By then the entire north side had been quarried away.  Only half of the original maunga remains today.

            VEGETATION RESTORATION
            Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain's native vegetation was all but destroyed through quarrying and other development, and exotic species were introduced in some parts of the maunga.

            In April 2019 work began on a programme to restore native vegetation and habitat for native wildlife at Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain.

            Around 112 exotic trees, including pest species, have been removed, and will be replaced with over 30,000 new native shrubs and trees over the next several planting seasons.

            New plantings are carefully positioned to enhance sight lines to and from the tihi (summit). Terrace planting has taken a non-dig approach to avoid ground disturbance.

            The restoration will have important long-term ecological benefits, restoring a sample of the maunga’s original ecology while also giving prominence to and maintaining historic features.

            <h1>Other information </h1>
            Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain is a 55 m high volcanic cone at Half Moon Bay, near Howick and Bucklands Beach, in Auckland, New Zealand. The cone forms the last part of volcanic activity that lasted many years. An earlier explosive eruption, created the prominent tuff ring that is still clearly visible extending in an arc south of Sunderlands Road. Two much smaller craters were formed to the north west of the main cone. The smaller lies buried under Pigeon Mountain Road outside number 18, and the other forms 'Heights Park' - a private reserve for the owners of 29 - 41 Pigeon Mountain Road and 14 - 36 Prince Regent Drive and 33 - 39 Tyrian Close. It forms part of the Auckland volcanic field and is popular for scientific school trips. It was first quarried for roading metal by fencibles from the 1847 fencibles settlement at Howick. Quarrying continued for many years. In the 1920s the Shaw brothers worked with Harold Kearney, Dud Langdon and Jim Taylor using a pair of draught horses to pull a dray loaded with metal. In 1848 John Campbell and James Smyth both from the fencible ship Sir Robert Sale, had the contract to spread metal on the road from Howick to Panmure, for which they were paid 5/-per day. At that time the mountain was named Pigeon Tree Hill

            The 5 acre farm immediately to the south was owned by the 1847 Irish Fitzpatrick family of Patrick and Ann who came in the "Minerva" fencible ship. They lived in a raupo hut at Howick for 2 years. They had had 12 children,9 of whom survived. The children all attended Pakuranga school, a short distance across the paddocks to the south east. Fitzpatrick later bought other land around Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain at Hutchinson Road and Bucklands Beach Rd expanding his farm to 20 acres. A photo taken of the Pakuranga Cricket club, which played at Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain, shows 6 of the 16 players were from the Fitzpatrick family. His original fencibles cottage was still in use in the 1960s by 2 of his grandsons who were the caretakers of the Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain sports ground in their youth. On their death the cottage was placed at the Howick Historical village. A number of fencibles' widows also received land south of Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain which was very swampy. Margaret Coyle received 4 acres of land where Pakuranga College is today. The mountain has been extensively quarried, with the entire north side of the volcano removed.

            In 1929 a fresh water spring was uncovered and water was piped to Howick and district at a cost of 9340 pounds. The mountain is a former pa site, and some of the terracing still remains. Artefacts as well as skulls were found there in the 1960s by students from Pakuranga College. The mountain is open to the public. The north face is partly fenced off and is an almost-vertical drop of 30 metres (100 ft).

            In the southwest corner there is a playing field built on a free-draining scoria base. On the quarried northwestern side is a kindergarten and Scout hall.

            In the 2014 Treaty of Waitangi settlement with the Tamaki Makaurau Collective of 13 Auckland iwi, the volcano was officially named Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain and ownership was vested to the collective. It is now co-governed by the collective and Auckland Council in common benefit of the iwi "and all other people of Auckland".
