            The following is a summary of the history only, and is largely a version of what has been written by Geoff Fairfield. It is recognised that individual Iwi will have their own histories andtraditions that pertain to the maunga that may differ or add more detail than what is outlined here.
            There is some uncertainty as to when the mountain was formed, possibly as long ago as 50000 years but possibly as recent as 20000 years ago.
            The pa eventually became a major settlement of Ngāi Tai, where they built terraces for living on andstoring their crops, built gardens around the lower slopes and gathered fresh water from a spring atthe foot of the basalt flows. The site was close to Tāmaki Estuary which gave ready access to various kai moana and acted as an ara (path) to the rest of the greater Tāmaki area (Auckland). The mountainwas fortified and many small villages (kainga) and gardens were spread around it. Fairfield believed that the site was occupied as a pa post European arrival as “two different types of lead ball bullets have been recovered within the defences.” Fairfield records that the Māori name for Pigeon Mountain was O Huiarangi. He concedes that there could be more than one interpretation of the name, but considers it most likely refers to it being the home of Huiarangi.
            From the 1860s the maunga was selected to be a site for quarrying, most of it being used for roading.
            The southern half (the now remaining portion) having been a Reserve since 1881 , being mapped on SO2184 in 1880, then remapped on SO2184A in 1885 with part of the Reserve being made quarry despite its prior legal status, it was then corrected by SO15236 in 1909.
            Originally the southern portion, the part that survives was set aside as a Quarry prior to being made a Recreation Reserve. Use as a Recreation Reserve saw the leveling of the cricket field and pavilions being developed by 1886, this effectively quarried away that part of the site in the corner of the Reserve. Other sporting activities that took place included organised MotorCycle Hill Climbs, Rugby, Athletics, a BMX track and Tennis.
